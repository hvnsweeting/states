Docker
======

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications
inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and
automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses
the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel
namespaces, and a union-capable filesystem such as aufs and others to allow
independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the
overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.
